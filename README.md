Using [Adafruit Trinkey QT2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5056),
[CircuitPython WiiChuck library](https://github.com/jfurcean/CircuitPython_WiiChuck),
and various Adafruit Arduino libraries, to turn a Wii Nunchuck
into a simple joystick/gamepad and* mouse emulator.

Onboard Neopixel indicate modes, which are switch with Button0* on the Trinkey.

**(It's the only button accessible in my little stack with the Trinkey sandwiched between the Nunchuck adapter and a 128x32 QT OLED.)*

Modes:
  * Nunchuck
    * L-Stick
      * Nunchuck stick Left-stick signals
      * Z sends Button 1 (South, XBox A, Nintendo B, PS Circle)
      * C sends Button 2 (East, XBox B, Nintendo A, PS X)

      * Buttons same as L-Stick Mode 
    * Mouse
      * Nunchuck stick sends mouse move signals
        * Z & C buttons send Left & Right clicks, respectively
        * ? Both together send middle click ?

      * Both sticks and D-pad send mouse movement
      * Full trigger pulls send left & right mouse clicks, either Z button sends middle click
